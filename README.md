# RxSwiftExampleApp_Pokemon
Example App for Talk on RxSwift/Reactive Code


#Purpose

This code is example code for the talk I delivered for VanXCoders around Reactive Programming and Swift. It's a simple example of using Reactive Programming, specificallyt RxSwift to connect to an API asynchronously and pull data into a tableview. Comments and notes are in the code.

#Resources

I will update this portion with the keynote file when the talk is complete.
